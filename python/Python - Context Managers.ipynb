    "**\"with .. as\"** clause simplifies your code by implicitly setting up the scope of resource usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"filename.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical pattern when working with \n",
    "- files\n",
    "- locks\n",
    "- db connections \n",
    "\n",
    "...and other resources that need \"closed\" in some way after their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic could be implemented by using more cumbersome **try..finally** block\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"file\")\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f.write(\"hello world\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "**with .. as** functionality was first introduced within Python 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "You could write your own custom contexts. To do it you just need to create a class with 3 implemented methods: init, enter and exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class ManagedClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self,filename):\n",
    "        self.filename = filename\n",
    "    def __enter__(self):\n",
    "        self.file = open(self.filename)\n",
    "        return self.file\n",
    "    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n",
    "        if self.file:\n",
    "            self.file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when compiler encounters **with .. as** block, for example:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "with ManagedFile(\"filename.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "it calls the __enter__ function and returns the opened resource in an alias variable **f**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you could have created a managed object before using it in **with .. as**, for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mf = ManagedFile(\"filename.txt\")\n",
    "with mf as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In that case comipler first calls init() when you create an object and then calls enter().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Functions\n",
    "In order to create a more function-like way of using context you can use decorated generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a contextlib module.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You need:\n",
    "1. to write a generator that yields an opened resource\n",
    "2. decorate it with @contextmanager\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@contextmanager\n",
    "def managed_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        f = open(filename)\n",
    "        yield f\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with managed_file(\"filename.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"hello world\")\n",
    "```"
