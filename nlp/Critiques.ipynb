    "They 4 classic problems: Hanoi towers, River overcoming, Elevator, Cubics. They allow to model complexity. The solution is the same, the amount reasoning should be equal\n",
    "What theyt found out:\n",
    "- as size goes up, LLMs quickly starts to fail\n",
    "- reasoing helps, but only for a couple of steps\n",
    "- giving more computational helped, but again only for a couple of steps\n",
    "- giving clear instructions (pseudocode) did not help\n",

    "Still LLM can easily provide correct Python solution"
