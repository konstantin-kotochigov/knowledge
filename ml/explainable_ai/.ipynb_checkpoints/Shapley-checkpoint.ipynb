    "\n",
    "Shapley Vector - a method of a \"fair\" gain distribution between team members, introduced in the mid 20th century in the research of cooperative games (games theory). The principle was later adopted in Machine Learning for determining individual feature contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem setting\n",
    "There is a set of players $\\{1, 2 … N\\}$ that will form a team. The team collectively do some work and gets a revenue at the end. The task is to construct a \"good\" distribution policy for the revenue. There are different definitions of goodness in game theory, but in general - those who contribute more should get more\n",
    "\n",
    "In primitive games players act independently. In individual sports competitions players who run faster / jump further than others, receive all the gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cooperative games players act in coordination: player X can secure player B, player C can be assigned to work he does the best and so on. The  goal is to maximize the overall team's gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ - a coalition (team) of players<br>\n",
    "$v(S)$ - what revenue does the team S receive in a game\n",
    "\n",
    "Player contribution (aka marginal contribution) is quite intuitive, it is \"revenue with player\" - \"revenue without player\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/formula1.png\" width=150>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method idea\n",
    "since player contribution depends on the team and we want to get a \"fair\" evaluation of it, it's better to average the contribution over ALL possible teamings. There are $n!$ possible teamings, so\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/formula2.png\" width=250>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute, it is convenient to list all team combinations that include player X through player permutations. That is, for each permutation $R$ we find the position of player $X$ within it and form with all preceeding (to the left) players\n",
    "\n",
    "The table illustrates this kind of iteration for 3 player coalitions. First, we list all permutations. Then compute the marginal contribution <br>The second column contains all contributions for player \"1\"\n",

    "Shapley Vector = the set of all Shapley Values<br>\n",
    "$\\varphi = \\{\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2 ... \\varphi_N \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula variants\n",
    "\n",
    "In most scenarios the gain does not depend on the order of players => we can simplify this formula by grouping teams that differ only by its order\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of permutations inside the coalition of players $S$ equals $|S|!$<br>\n",
    "The number of permutations of other players that we exclude equals $(N-S-1)!$<br>\n",
    "Thus we can rewrite:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/formula4.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we take $1/n$ out of the braces, we can also rewrite it using combination notation\n",

Поменяем порядок суммирования - по строкам все всегда суммируется в v(N), так как мы суммируем дельты и, получается, порядок не важен.
