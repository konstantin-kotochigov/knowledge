    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional scaling is a concept that appeared in statistics in 1950s. It's goal is to find such a projection onto some lower-dimensional space so that it <u>preserves all distances</u> between the points as much as possible. Most frequently MDS is used for data visualization, so the new dimensionality is often chosen to be 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Most known with contributions by Kruskal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of notation notes:\n",
    "- in MDS the target space is often referred to as [ordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics)) space\n",
    "     because in non-metric MDS what we do is we try to ordinate points in order to retain the structure of a dataset\n",
    "- dataset coordinates in a target space is called configuration\n",
    "     because dataset coordinates is exactly what is being optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've got as an input?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike PCA, we don't have dataset coordinates, we have to deal some [dissimilarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) matrix - a square matrix that contains pairwise distances between the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether in PCA we are rtying to retain high-level axis-based linear structure, here the structure that we are trying to preserve is way more detailed and complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's denote our input dissimilarity matrix as D_{old}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^{old}_{ij} = dis(x_i,x_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we did some mapping and now have 2 dissimilarity matrixes $D_{old}$ in the original space and $D_{new}$ in the target space. The goal is to preserve distances as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means:\n",
    "- we need to define some loss function that compares old and new distance matrices $L(D_{old}, D_{new})$\n",
    "- we need to find a configuration $X_{new}$ that<u>minimizes</u> the loss function L\n",
    "So, to this point, we formulated some optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 1\n",
    "We will think of ${D_{new}}$ as a matrix of <u>Euclidean</u> distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not make much sense to choose more complex distances, since we need it only for visualiztion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^{new}_{ij}(X) = {||x_i - x_j ||}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In general $D_{old}$ can contain any distance metrics (depending on the alogirithm variant).\n",
    "\n",
    "But in case of classic metric-MDS we also assume that $D_{old}$ was <u>also</u> calculated using Euclidean distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "(though in general, there are MDS variants that allow other metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^{old}_{ij}(X) = {||x_i - x_j ||}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{new} = \\underset{X}{\\operatorname{{arg\\,min}}} \\sum_{i \\ne j} {\\left( D^{new}_{ij}(X) - D^{old}_{ij}\\right)}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme of the process is described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/mds.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don't observe original coordinates.\n",
    "- We need to find X that minimaizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So how we do it for classic MDS?\n",
    "1. We compute a decentered distance matrix. \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Each element represents distances between a pair of points in a dataset\n",
    "2. We do eigendecomposition of that distance matrix \n",
    "        \n",
    "        It gives us a set of eigenvectors of that matrix\n",
    "3. We project original dataset onto the first K components\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a couple of minutes I will give a more formal proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relation to PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "MDS is similar to PCA in a way that it also uses the eigendecomposition to get reduced coordinates. It's even refered to as PCoA (Principal Coordinate Analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "But the formulation is a bit different\n",
    "- for PCA = to preserve data variation after mapping\n",
    "- for MDS = to preserve pairwise distances after mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in MDS we work with distance matrix instead of covariance matrix, which makes this approach a bit more general, becasuse we can apply arbitrary metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Flavours of MDS\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, there are several enhancements of classic MDS:\n",
    "- two popular ones are metric-MDS and non-metruc MDS\n",

    "1. We'll describe our algorithm in matrix notation\n",
    "2. We'll show that eigenvectors projection gives optimal approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick aside, let's explore what the centering matrix is.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Centering matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centering_matrix) is a concise way to subtract mean from matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote $I_n$ an identity matrix; $J_n$ - matrix of all ones, then we can formulate it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_n =  I_n - \\tfrac{1}{n}J_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_3 = \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr}\n",

    "Double centering = applying demeaning matrices twice\n",
    "$$CXC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case each row and column will have an average of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "Let's describe $D_{old}$ in original (unknown) coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{ij}={\\left\\lVert x_i - x_j \\right\\rVert}^2 = (x_i-x_j, x_i-x_j)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{ij}= {\\left\\lVert x_i \\right\\rVert}^2 -2\\left\\lVert x_i\\right\\rVert \\left\\lVert x_j \\right\\rVert + {\\left\\lVert x_j\\right\\rVert}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a matrix notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^X =  Z - 2X^TX + Z^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ and $Z^T$ contain squared norms of two points; $X^TX$ are dot products of point pairs; \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/mds_proof1.png\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those products in the middle are used to subtract part of distance explained by two points similarity. If points are perpendicular, the distance between them is just a sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's apply double decentering to our distance matrix $D^X$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z$ and $Z^T$ are row/column constant => they vanish out\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CD^XC = -2CX^TXC$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can rewrite it a bit:\n",
    "\n",

    "- matrix multiplication is associative\n",
    "- $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$\n",
    "- $C^T=C$ because C is symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\hat{X}^T$ and $\\hat{X}$ - decentered coordinate matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually that's quite an obvious fact - distance matrix don't care about absolute coordinates => it correspond to decentered dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote this decentered distance matrix by $B^X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B^X = -\\frac{1}{2}CD^XC = \\hat{X}^T\\hat{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to find best rank-k approximation of decentered distance matrix $\\hat{X}^T\\hat{X}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$B^y = \\underset{B^Y}{argmin} = ||B^X - B^Y||^2 = ||\\hat{X}^T\\hat{X} - Y^TY||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that Y's that we are seeking for, will also represent the decentered coordinates, not the original ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that here we use Frobenius norm - it is the same as minimizaing mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Such optimization is done by SVD decomposition. \n",

    "There is a theorem. Suppose we deal with matrix A, then\n",
