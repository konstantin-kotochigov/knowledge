    "LLE = Locally Linear Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/lectures/ml/lle.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Global Geometry => we compute distances between all pairs of data points\n",
    "2. Local Geometry => we describe each data point as linear approximation of it's K nearest neighbors\n",
    "3. Preserving Projection => we try to find projections that preserve those linear combinations in a smaller space\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Locally Linear Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **embeddings** because we are seeking for descriptions in a reduced latent space\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **local** because it makes use of local structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **linear** because we try to presereve linear approximations of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the visualization by the authors\n",

    "\n",
    "To make the preserved structure density-independent for each point they \n",
    "convert neighbours to baricentric coordinates - subtract the point from its neighbors\n",
    "normalize the linear combination coefficients - make them sum to one\n",
    "\n",
    "### In more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know nearest neighbors of each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 - Finding W\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to find corresponding linear combination for each point\n",

    "$$ x_i \\approx \\sum_{j \\in N(x_i)} w_{j}\\eta_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This task can be formulated as a least squares problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_i = \\left| x_i - \\sum_{j \\in N(x_i)} w_{j} \\cdot \\eta_j \\right|^2 \\rightarrow min $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These individual tasks can be formulated as one optimization problem with weight matrix $W = \\{ w_{i,j} \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\sum_i \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i \\big| x_i - \\sum_{j \\in N(x)} w_{ij} \\cdot \\eta_j \\big |^2 \\rightarrow min $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also apply 2 constraints:\n",
    "- weights must sum to one in each row\n",
    "- non-zero weights must correspons only to neigbors\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\sum_i \\bigg| \\sum_{j \\in N(x)} w_{ij} \\cdot x_i - \\sum_{j \\in N(x)} x_i - w_{ij} \\cdot \\eta_j \\bigg| ^2 = \\sum_i \\bigg|  \\sum_{j \\in N(x)} w_{ij}(x_i-\\eta_j) \\bigg|^2 \\rightarrow min $$\n",

    "It's a minimization problem with constrain, so we can use Lagrange multipliers to solve it.\n",

    "#### Step 3 - Finding Y\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we move to latent space $Y$. We fixed the weight matrix $W$ and now we need to optimize projections $y_i$ - we minimize the total loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i {\\left( y_i - \\sum_{j} w_{ij} y_j \\right)}^2 \\rightarrow min$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that loss function above is a quadratic form of the form $yM^Ty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get optimal projections we find two eigenvectors with least eigenvalues for this matrix.\n",

    "Recall the Rayleigh quotient theorem:\n",

    "To get minimum value we need to find eigenvector that corresponds to $\\lambda_{min}$\n",
