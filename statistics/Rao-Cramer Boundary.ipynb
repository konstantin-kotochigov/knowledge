    "#### Problem setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume some distribution $P(X|\\theta)$ depends on parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also assume there is some estimate for this parameter $\\hat{\\theta}$. It could be, for example, Maximum Likelihood Estimate - for a sample **X** we found $\\hat{\\theta}$ that best explains X. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being an estimate (which means being a random variable) it of course has some expectation $E(\\hat{\\theta})$ and variance $V(\\hat{\\theta})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If estimate is good enough, it's unbiased, meaning that expectation equals the real parameter value. There is nothing much to explore here. But what about the variance? Can we assess somehow the magnitude of this variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "$V(\\hat{\\theta})$ can be viewed just as a mean squared error of the expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitevly this error is higher the lower the difference in the neighborhood (in terms of corresponsing X distributions) of $\\theta$. Because in that case we miss more often. That's exactly what Rao-Cramer therorem states.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$var(\\theta)=E(\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^ 2 \\le \\frac{1}{I(\\theta)}$$\n",
    "where $I(\\theta)$ - fisher information\n",
    "$$I(\\theta) = E_x \\bigg[ \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\bigg] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the illustration. At the peak the second derivatives are low. On the sides they are high - there the likelihood functions change rapidly.\n",

    "Without loss of generality we will depict samples **X** as if they were scalars x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **X**  is a random variable and has its own distribution. This distribution is dependent on $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is to predict $\\theta$ based on observed X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every estimator misses and distribution of its error $\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta$ (across different implementations of **X**) is chartacterized by its bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second derivative is taken with respect of parameter $\\theta$! For each sample **X** It shows how likelihood changes in the neighborhood of $\\theta$ if current value of parameter is $\\theta$.\n",
