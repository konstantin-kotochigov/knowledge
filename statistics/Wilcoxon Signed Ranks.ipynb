    "Wilcoxon signed test is a nonparametric (rank) test to check $H_0$ that there is no difference between 2 __paired__ groups\n",

    "To work with this kind of data we construct a single dataset of differences $X=X_A-X_B$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Idea:__ irrespective of magnitudes of differences their directions (a > b or otherwise) must be distributed evenly - for each positive difference there must be correposnding negative difference. Therefore medians of positive and negative differences (sumed ranks) should coincide\n",

    "1. Observation = difference $X_A - X_B$\n",
    "2. Merge data in a single pool, order it by absolute value\n",
