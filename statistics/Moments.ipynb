    "Moment of a function is a measure of the function shape \n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory it is a statistic over the variable distribution - see definitions below\n",

    "__Raw moment__ is a weighted by PDF power of the argument\n",

    "Skewness measures an expected deviation around the mean (raised to 3rd power)<br> It is normalized by the same power of standard deviation to make it scale-invariant.\n",
