Here I store my condensed knowledge about Data Science / Analytics topics. Mostly they include Machine Learning, Computer Science and Mathematics with focus on theory (somtetimes enriched with usage examples and exercises)

I try to make the descriptions as concise and clear as possbile and offer them as an alternative to wordly textbooks - I restrain to the essential concepts only and bypass the ones that are too theoretic or unapplicable in practice

I personally use it 
1) as a cheatsheet when I need to recall theory before the interviews
2) as a base for lessons when I need to teach some concept to students
