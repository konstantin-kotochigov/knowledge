    "How do we know if a new feature is potentially useful apart from common reasoning? \n",
    "To some extent offline testing  helps us. Offline, also called retrospetctive, testing we don't run product in production, we mathematicallt model how change would work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Offline testing is a necessary step for any feature. But unfortunately it's very limited in its power. You simply can't model everything, you can't take every possible factor into account, such kind of prediction would be unreliable, prediction how feature would work in a new setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why it's insufficient, you also need online tests - to see how it works in production.\n",
    "In software development this is called A/B testing, because you compare two alternatives A and B. In a broader sense, hypotesys testing in the design of experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the idea is simple - just run two alternatives and see wich one is better. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why dedicate a whole lecture to it? Because there are two complications to the process:\n",
    "1. you have to guarantee the same conditions for both alternatives as well target environment, otherwise your conclusion could be wrong and you would not know that it's wrong\n",
    "2. Second point is even more important - your conclusion could wrong simply by chance. This is because that we observe is probabilistic customer behavior is prone to uncertainty. So you need to somehow assess the trustworthiness of your conclusion.\n",
